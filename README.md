# Shadow
A jailbreak detection bypass for modern iOS jailbreaks.

## Issues
Please note that Shadow is **not** designed as an app-specific bypass. Issues mainly in consideration are non-detection related app crashes, regressions from previous versions, and compatibility issues.

## Installation
Add my repo (`https://ios.jjolano.me`) to your package manager and install the Shadow (`me.jjolano.shadow`) package. Alternatively, download the [latest release](https://github.com/jjolano/shadow/releases) directly from GitHub and open the file with your package manager.

## Usage
After installation, settings are available in the Settings app. You may configure global defaults, or add an app-specific configuration.
