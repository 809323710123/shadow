# Shadow

A jailbreak detection bypass for modern iOS jailbreaks.

## Known Issues

### palera1n

While Shadow does work fine on palera1n, please note the following potential issues:

* Re-jailbreaking does not reactivate `libSandy` due to the lack of userspace rebooting. To fix this issue, you will need to reinstall the `libSandy` package after activating the jailbreak. This affects Shadow's ability to load preferences.
* On iOS 16.2 (and probably future versions), Substitute appears to have issues hooking C functions. This may be fixed in a future update to the jailbreak if/when it switches to ElleKit. In this case, please use the `fishhook` hooking library.
* You may see `shdw: Killed: 9` in your package manager. It is safe to ignore this error message.

### Xina (iOS 15)

There are no guarantees if Shadow will function properly on Xina. You may find that some apps fail to be bypassed, while it works for another jailbreak. You may also find inconsistent tweak behaviour. For this reason, I cannot offer support for Xina.

## Troubleshooting

Some ideas to try:

* Use a different hooking library. `fishhook` is a safe option.
* Disable all tweaks except Shadow. You can use Choicy or libhooker Configurator to do this per-app.
* Use vnodebypass, if supported on your system.
* If semi-(un)tethered, reboot into normal jailed iOS and use the app.
* Use another bypass tweak, ideally an app-specific bypass tweak. Be wary of enabling multiple bypass tweaks in case of conflicts.
* Downgrade the app. Sometimes, newer versions have updated detection methods.

## Installation

Add my [repo](https://ios.jjolano.me) to your package manager and install the Shadow (`me.jjolano.shadow`) package. Alternatively, download the [latest release](https://github.com/jjolano/shadow/releases/latest) directly from GitHub and open the file with your package manager.

You may need additional repositories for dependencies - these are the current dependencies:

* `libSandy` from [opa334's Repo](https://opa334.github.io)
* `AltList` from [opa334â€˜s Repo](https://opa334.github.io)
* `HookKit Framework`

A recommended (but not required) package is `Injection Foundation` from PoomSmart's Repo (`https://poomsmart.github.io/repo`). This package ensures that Shadow is injected properly into certain apps.

## Usage

After installation, settings are available in the Settings app. You may configure global defaults, or add an app-specific configuration. Shadow allows fine-grained control of its bypass strength, so there will be many options available to configure.
